My goal is to create a pipeline for conducting genotype-environment association (GEA) analyses using RAD-seq data.

- describe RAD-seq data
- describe decision for simulated environmental data

My workflow will consist of the following:

Use Stacks to demultiplex, filter and trim adapters from the data. I will map to the reference genome and identify SNPs suitable for downstream analyses...
